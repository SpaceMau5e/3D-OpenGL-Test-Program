# 3D-OpenGL-Test-Program
Test Program for Rendering 3D graphics using OpenGL

This is a first person maze explorer game which was my first attempt at making a 3D game using OpenGL and C++ that has both collision and graphics but does not meet up to my personal expectations as I wanted to also have baked in graphics.

I have continued this project further and developed a better system for handling collisions and 3D graphics, a better way to handle baking textures and methods for creating objects like props and projectiles in the 3D space. This new version does not have a github page yet as I am still working it to a testable state but it will soon be there.
